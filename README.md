<h1>Hosts File Minifier in Python</h1>
Downloads a text hosts source and converts it to a file located in the same directory as the script. Removes Comments, unnecessary whitespaces, empty lines and duplicates.<br><br>

Default hosts source is Dan Pollock's "https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/zero/hosts", can be changed to any other hosts source though.
